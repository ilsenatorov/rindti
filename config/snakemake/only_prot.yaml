# structures parameter decides whether to calculate `whole` structure, substructure aligned with `template` or `bsite`.
# `plddt` means that the loops with low plddt are removed
# resources/templates has to be present and contain valid structures for last 2 to work
# plddt works only for alphafold structures, since plddt is written in the b-factor there
structures: whole
# radius (in Angstroms) around ligands for which residues are considered to be part of the binding site

# cutoff for plddt score to remove flailing loops and whatnot

  threshold: 50

# how to compute the graphs
# `rinerator` uses rinerator, also can produce edge labels
# `distance` just uses a threshold distance between CA atoms

distance:

# If set to true, only computes the proteins data, skips drugs (for pretraining)

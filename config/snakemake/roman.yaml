# structures parameter decides whether to calculate `whole` structure, substructure aligned with `template` or `bsite`.
# `plddt` means that the loops with low plddt are removed
# resources/templates has to be present and contain valid structures for last 2 to work
# plddt works only for alphafold structures, since plddt is written in the b-factor there
structures: whole
# radius (in Angstroms) around ligands for which residues are considered to be part of the binding site
bsite:
  radius: 5
# radius (in Angstroms) around residues from template to match residues from the query structure
template:
  radius: 2
# cutoff for plddt score to remove flailing loops and whatnot
plddt:
  threshold: 50

# `rinerator` uses rinerator, also can produce edge labels
# `distance` just uses a threshold distance between CA atoms
